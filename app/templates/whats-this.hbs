        This tool, which was designed by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for small to medium businesses, creates basic privacy statements. A privacy statement  tells people how you will be  collecting, using and disclosing their information. A good privacy statement is important because New Zealand agencies are required by law to be transparent about how, when and why they collect personal information.
