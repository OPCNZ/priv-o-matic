              ou need to have a valid reason to share information with outside parties, related to your purpose for collecting it. This doesn’t apply if you gathered the information from a public source, or you have asked the user’s permission.
            </p>

            <p>
              When you’re dealing with cloud providers who are just storing or processing information on your behalf, you don’t strictly have to include them. We say err on the side of transparency and tell people. For advice on this, we recommend engaging a privacy consultant or lawyer.
